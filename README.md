# Danish Fire Insurance Dataset
This dataset contains real-world data on fire insurance claims from Denmark, collected between 1980 and 1990. It includes individual claim amounts (in Danish Krone) and is commonly used for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory, and actuarial risk analysis.
Features:
  Observations: ~2,160 fire insurance claims
  Variable: Loss – claim size in DKK (adjusted for inflation)
  Use cases: Extreme value modeling, tail risk estimation, loss distribution fitting
  Source: Originally from M. Ekström, “Data on large fire insurance claims”, and popularized via R’s evir and actuar packages.
